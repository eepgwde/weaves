This provides a multi-cast announcement sender for q/kdb+

It is designed to allow a q-server (typically a ticker-plant client) to announce it
has new data.

The packet it sends contains the host IP and port number and an optional list of symbol names.

This system was originally developed to allow a pyq Python CPython client to receive an update
in a socket thread in Python under GIL. This could then be used to connect to the server and
get its new data.

Python needs to use asyncio and this is only available with Python3.
