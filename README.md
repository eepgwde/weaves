* More details in each project

I have only maintained qsys. It tries to implement a Trader function for
q servers, see RM-ODP, ITU-T Rec. X.950 | ISO/IEC 13235-1:1998

And I do use the emacs and xemacs modes.

I haven't stayed on the top of the rest.

There is also a minor change to q2r/. This too is not maintained for a
while.

There are some Windows builds. I can't make any promises they will now work.
